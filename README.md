        <h3>  In the "E-commerce Sales Data Analysis"
 the project, I employed Power BI to delve into sales
 data, focusing on profit analysis. The investigation
 included assessing profit by sales, monthly profit
 trends, popular payment modes, category-wise
 profitability, and identifying the top 5 performing
 products. The outcome is a dynamic and visually
 compelling Power BI dashboard, offering actionable
 insights for informed decision-making</h3>
